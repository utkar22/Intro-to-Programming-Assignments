# Data Processing and Analysis

## Introduction
This project consists of two modules: `a2.py` and `simulation.py`. The purpose of this project is to implement various functions to process and analyze data stored in JSON format. The `a2.py` module contains the main functions, while the `simulation.py` module simulates an interactive menu-based scenario to interact with the implemented functions.

## Functionality
The `a2.py` module contains the following functions for data processing and analysis:

1. `filter_by_first_name`: Filters records by first name.
2. `filter_by_last_name`: Filters records by last name.
3. `filter_by_full_name`: Filters records by full name.
4. `filter_by_age_range`: Filters records by age range.
5. `count_by_gender`: Counts records by gender.
6. `filter_by_address`: Filters records by address.
7. `find_alumni`: Finds alumni based on education status.
8. `find_topper_of_each_institute`: Finds the topper of each institute.
9. `find_blood_donors`: Finds blood donors.
10. `get_common_friends`: Retrieves common friends between two persons.
11. `is_related`: Checks if two persons are related.
12. `delete_by_id`: Deletes a record by ID.
13. `add_friend`: Adds a friend to a person's record.
14. `remove_friend`: Removes a friend from a person's record.
15. `add_education`: Adds education details to a person's record.

## Usage
